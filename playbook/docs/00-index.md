Below is a **precise `playbook/docs/*` outline** you can drop into a repo today. It’s structured so:

* **Builders** can follow a clear “start here” path.
* **Steering committee** has an operational handbook.
* **Users** can quickly understand “is this safe to use?” and “what does MongoDB commit to?”

I’m assuming the org is `mongodb-pipeline` and this lives in `mongodb-pipeline/playbook`.

**Purpose:** Front door for the playbook
**Contents:**

* What this playbook is / who it’s for
* The two big promises: *clarity of expectations* + *faster iteration in public*
